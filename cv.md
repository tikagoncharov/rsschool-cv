## About
Hi. I'm 23 y.o. Computer Science bachelor from Novosibirsk. In my graduation project I wrote an optimization program that shows an optimized rectangular packing. Then I was inspired to create an application with an interface for interacting with program input. Despite the fact that I didn't have time for it then, my striving to create interfaces hasn't faded. That's how I got interested in creating interfaces, thus I'm studying front-end development. I started not so long ago, but already know the basics: HTML, CSS, JS. My purpose at the moment is to create a several sites in pure HTML, CSS, JS for my portfolio. And my long-term goal is to learn Sass, TypeScript, React for advanced front-end development and then learn backend (Node.js) for fullstack development.

## Skills
* HTML, CSS, JS
* Git, GitHub

## Code example

];

alert( unique(values) ); 
```
